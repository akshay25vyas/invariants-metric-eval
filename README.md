# A Novel Approach to Evaluating Evaluation Metrics for Multi-Output Structured Prediction

Code repository for the AAAI-26 paper:

> A Novel Approach to Evaluating Evaluation Metrics for Multi-Output Structured Prediction  
> Akshay Vyas, Angelo Pimienta, Nicholas Ruozzi

This repository will contain:

- Training scripts for invariant-regularized models
- Evaluation scripts for traditional and distributional metrics (e.g., PSNR, FID/FBD/FDD, BERTScore)
- Configuration files and instructions for experiments.

We are in the process of cleaning and organizing the code and will push updates over time.
